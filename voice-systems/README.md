python voice-systems/gemini-tts/quick_tts_test.py "Test execution complete"

## Command Execution Rules
**Required**: Command permission system must be used before all Bash command execution.

### Full-Featured Version (Voice Recognition) [Recommended]
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "<command>" "<clear Japanese description>"

### Simple Version
python voice-systems/command-permission/simple_command_permission.py "<command>" "<clear Japanese description>"

**Without exception, use this system before using Claude Code's Bash tools.**

### New Feature: Execution Method Selection
The command permission system provides the following options:

1. **[P] Python Execution** - Direct execution within script
   - Immediate execution and result confirmation
   - Voice completion notifications
   - Voice feedback on errors

2. **[C] Claude Execution** - Execute via Claude Code (traditional method)
   - Execute through Claude Code tools
   - Safer execution environment

3. **[N] Do Not Execute** - Cancel
   - Cancel command execution

### Usage Examples and Workflow

#### Safe Commands (In Whitelist)
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "git status" "Check Git status"
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "ls -la" "List directory contents"
→ Light notification sound only, showing approved status

#### Dangerous Commands (Not in Whitelist)
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "rm -rf old_files" "Delete old files"
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "npm install express" "Install Express package"
python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "git push origin main" "Push to main branch"
→ Warning sound + voice "Not in whitelist. Execute [description]?"

### Second Argument Guidelines
The second argument should contain **Japanese description that will be read aloud as-is**:

#### Good Examples
- "Delete old files"
- "Install Express package"
- "Create database backup"
- "Compress log files"
- "Restart development server"

#### Examples to Avoid
- "Execute rm -rf old_files" (Too technical)
- "File deletion command" (Vague)
- "dangerous operation" (English)

### [Strict Adherence] Execution Flow
1. **Required**: python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "command" "description" check
2. Wait for voice confirmation if not in whitelist
3. **Then**: Execute actual command with Claude Code Bash tools
4. Complete

### Important Notes
- **Direct Bash command execution in Claude Code is prohibited**
- **Command permission system must be executed first**
- **There are no exceptions to this rule**

### Prohibited Actions
❌ Direct execution like Bash(tree voice-systems)
❌ Skipping command permission system
❌ Ignoring rules for "emergency" reasons

✅ Correct procedure:
1. python voice-systems/command-permission/command_permission.py "tree voice-systems" "Check directory structure"
2. After voice confirmation completion, execute Bash(tree voice-systems)
```
